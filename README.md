### Usage

Clone this repository or [use it as a template][generate] to generate a new repository.

Update the project name and metadata in `pyproject.toml` and `configs/main.ini`.

#### External dependencies

- [Conda][conda]
- [Docker][docker]
- [Make][make]

#### Create environment

Use Conda to create a virtual environment and activate it for the project.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate vardict
```

#### Update Lock file 

Update lock file will ensure dependencies like Poetry and PyVcf are not removed 
```bash 
poetry lock --no-update
```
#### Install dependencies

Then install project dependencies with Poetry.

```bash
make deps-install
```

#### Updating Environment

To update the environment after initial setup up run: 

```bash
conda update env -f environment.yml
```

instead of `conda create`, and then re-run `poetry lock --no-update` and `make deps-install`

# Post-processing of variant calls

This hosts multiple scripts necessary for filtering and processing of variant calls in the vcfs/txt file generated by callers.

## Callers Supported
`pv` is the main command for the `postprocessing_variant_calls` package see `pv --help` to see supported variant callers commands. 

### VarDictJava

The sub-command `pv vardict` allows users to perform post-processing on VarDictJava output. The two supported inputs to `pv vardict` from VarDictJava are `single` and `case-control` vcfs. 

To specify to `pv vardict`, which input type will be used one of the following sub-commands may be used: 
- `pv vardict single` for single sample vcfs 
- `pv vardict case-control` for case-controlled vcfs. 

Next the user can specify, what post-processing should be done. Right now, `postprocessing_variant_calls` supports filtering: 
-  `pv vardict single filter` 
-  `pv vardict case-control filter` 

Finally, we can specify the paths and options for our filtering and run our command. Here is an example using the test data provided in this repository: 

`pv vardict single filter --inputVcf data/Myeloid200-1.vcf  --tsampleName Myeloid200-1  -ad 1 -o data/single`

There are various options and input specifications for filtering so see `pv vardict single filter --help` or `pv vardict single case-sontrol --help` for help. 

See `example_calls.sh` for more example calls.

### Usage

Clone this repository or [use it as a template][generate] to generate a new repository.

Update the project name and metadata in `pyproject.toml` and `configs/main.ini`.

#### External dependencies

- [Conda][conda]
- [Docker][docker]
- [Make][make]

#### Create environment

Use Conda to create a virtual environment and activate it for the project.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate vardict
```

#### Install dependencies

Then install project dependencies with Poetry.

```bash
make deps-install
```

#### Updating Environment

To update the environment after initial setup up run: 

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

instead of `conda create`, and then re-run `make deps-install`
